# React.JS Basic CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) Operations 

## Overview
This sample React.JS with Typescript project shows a basic implementation of CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) Operations that is connected to a web api. I'd advice that you have a working web api to be able to fully tested this project.

Basically, this project has an [axios]([https://github.com/axios/axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)) package installed where you can do different web api request like `post`, `put`, `get` and `delete`. I also already installed the package [react-router-dom]([https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react-router-dom)) for routing of the app so you will also have idea on how to implement it on your next React.JS application.
